# FriendlyBot

Hello, friend! You've reached the home of FriendlyBot, a Tak bot
designed to be a tool to help you learn the game of Tak.

# Playing FriendlyBot

You can play games against FriendlyBot on playtak.com. Log in and find
the bot's name under "Join game". If it's not there, it might be
occupied right now -- it can only play one person at a time right now.

# Changing the difficulty level

FriendlyBot supports playing at a number of different difficulty
levels.

To change the difficulty level, just say

    FriendlyBot: level <level>"

in chat. It supports a number of levels, from 1 up through 12, at the
moment.

The levels have somewhat different styles of play, in addition to
being harder or easier, so try a few different levels, even if you're
struggling with one.

If you're playing the bot, you can even change the difficulty level
mid-game.

Levels 10 and up are roughly equivalent to Taktician at various stages
of its development, and so should be considered pretty challenging.

FriendlyBot can also play on different sizes of board: Try

    FriendlyBot: size <size>
